## Open-Source, Open-Data, Global Electricity System Models

![OSeMOSYS Global](./docs/_static/osemosys-global.png "OSeMOSYS Global")

OSeMOSYS Global is an open-source, open-data model generator for creating
global energy system models. It can be used to create inter-connected energy
systems models for both the entire globe and for any geographically diverse
subset of the globe. Compared to other existing global models, OSeMOSYS Global
creates a full energy system representation, allows for full user flexibility
in determining the modelling detail and geographic scope, and is built using
the fully open-source [OSeMOSYS](https://osemosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
energy system model.
