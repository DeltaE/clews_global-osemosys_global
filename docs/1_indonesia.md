# Indonesia

The first application of FEO is the development of an electricity systems model 
for Indonesia. 

## Model scope

### Spatial resolution
The model represents 34 provinces of Indonesia, across 7 regions:
 - Sumatra
 - Java
 - Kalimantan
 - Nusa Tenggara
 - Sulawesi
 - Maluku
 - Papua

### Temporal resolution

### Model horizon

## Key assumptions

- Discount rates
- Reserve margin 60% -> 35%
- 

## Data 
### Technology costs

- Capital costs (USD<sub>2020</sub>/kW, except for *Battery storage* which is in USD <sub>2020</sub>/kWh)

### Electricity interconnectors


## Scenarios

The model was used to explore three scenarios: *Current Policies [CP]*, 
*Least-cost [LC]*, and *Net-Zero [NZ]*. The scenarios represent alternate 
pathways for the expansion of Indonesia's electricity system. Each scenario 
consists of a set of assumptions and constraints, as detailed below:

### Current policies

This scenario includes all implemented policies related to the expansion of 
Indonesia's electricity system as well as power plants under construction. 
The policies included are: 

And the future power plants included are:

### Least-cost


### Net-zero


## Results


## Planned improvements

- Interconnector expansion plans
- Fossil fuel price projections
- Plant-specific efficiencies
- Hydropower capacity factor by plant / node
- Technology-specific discount rates
