# Future Energy Outlook

## Overview
'Future Energy Outlook' (FEO) is an open source electricity system model generator
with global coverage. It uses [OSeMOSYS Global](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01737-0) as 
a starting point and can be used to create inter-connected energy
systems models for both the entire globe and for any geographically diverse
subset of the globe. It is built using the fully open-source 
[OSeMOSYS](https://osemosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) energy system modelling tool.!

## Getting started

#### 1. Install `GLPK`

[GNU GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/#downloading) package is a open-source linear programming package. OSeMOSYS Global uses it to create a linear programming file.

#### 2. Install a Solver
